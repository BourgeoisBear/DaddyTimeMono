### Special thanks to:

- George Williams and the entire [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) team for making a useful creative tool freely available.
- The [ttfautohint](https://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/) team and their fantastic tool for making this font usable at lower resolutions.
- Ricardo BÃ¡nffy of [3270 font](https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font) fame for sharing an image of the Cordata PPC-400 BIOS font.
- Whoever designed the PPC-400 font back in the day that has provided such sweet, sweet inspiration.

## Notes

- If you're using PuTTY, you will need to check "*allow selection of variable-pitch fonts*" for DaddyTimeMono to appear in the fonts dialog.  The CJK fullwidth characters are twice the width of all other characters, and prevent PuTTY from recognizing it as a monospaced font.
